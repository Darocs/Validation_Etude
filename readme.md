This is an etude about our validation approach in android projects
It consists of best practices used by our team including
* value objects validation with type-safe errors
* only one check at a time: fail-first [Secure by Design](https://www.manning.com/books/secure-by-design)
* errors in check result are not throwable but typed errors of sealed classes
* [parse, don't validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/) and

About Etudes series. Etudes were established to reflect the best practices developed by our team in order to use in our projects.
We try to keep Etudes as a reference both with docs and code as well with sufficient tests.
We understand Etude with both musical and painting essentials - to prepare a part of masterpiece and to practice for perfecting a skill.
